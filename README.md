# CS210
Projects from course CS 210
This project is for the Project Three submission of the Programming Languages course. This README.md file serves as the final assignment for the course:

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
The Corner Grocer project allows the related business client to use a CLI Application to import a text file of items based on what sold in their store and then visualize that data and back it up in a more analytical fashion. This project utilizes multiple OOP practices to help achieve this functionality.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I feel that I aapproached the code layout relatively well, specifically with handling the mapping and Item's as individual objects for adaptibility.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
Obviously, more of the functionality could have been relegated to the classes or included as separate files/libraries to allow for the main file to be more concise. It could also use more potential error handling for incorrect file formats.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
Working with pointers was particularly hard as it was my first time utilizing such technology before. 

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
Skills such as unit testing and code design in pre-production will translate well to further course work in my CS Degree program. Particularly unit/bench tests, as I began the project making a separte file to write and test the main logic of the program: importing the file and populating the map.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
For each function I in the program, there are multi-line comments in a fashion I like to do:
@func    - Describes the proceeding function's purpose
@params  - param_name: describe it's purpose

Single line comments were also inserted in areas I believe could have caused confusion in following along.
